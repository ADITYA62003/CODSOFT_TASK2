            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>"I am a B.Tech student specializing in computer science, proficient in HTML and CSS for web development,
                and skilled in C++ and Python programming languages. I have hands-on experience in building web
                applications and solving complex computational problems."</p>
            <p>As a student at SHRI Ramswaroop Memorial University, I navigate a dynamic blend of academic rigor and
                personal passions. My journey involves not only attending lectures and grappling with challenging
                coursework but also finding solace and creativity in my hobbies.

                Outside the lecture halls, you might find me immersed in the melody of a musical instrument, cultivating
                the tranquility of gardening, experimenting with flavors in the kitchen, or diving into immersive worlds
                through gaming. These activities offer me a reprieve from the demands of engineering studies, where
                meticulous note-taking, deadline management, and rigorous preparation are constants.

            <P> The engineering course structure at SHRI Ramswaroop Memorial University demands thorough preparation and
                a keen understanding of complex subjects.</p>
